## A concrete example of the problem

Thanks to the method I chose when implementing the solution, there's
now a concrete example of the problem, which can be used to demonstrate
the problem in a practical step-by-step manner.

A practical step-by-step demonstration of the problem follows below.

Imagine you're building the chat application described in [_Methods:
Implementation: Developing an example
application_](methods#developing-an-example-application), using
[React.js](https://react.dev/) and [TanStack
Query](https://tanstack.com/query).

### Initial code

<ConcreteExampleInitialCode />

### Updating UI when new chat messages arrive

<ConcreteExampleUpdatingUI />

### Handling the case where the chat room doesn't exist in the `["chat-rooms"]` query's cached data

<ConcreteExampleHandlingCaseWhereChatRoomDoesNotExist />

### Dealing with concurrency

<ConcreteExampleConcurrency />

### Summing it up

The `onNewChatMessage` function was just one query cache updater. As the
app grows, the need to create more of these updaters will arise, and
while the code can be organized into neat file structures and parts of
it can be extracted into helper functions that can be reused across
those files, there will still no doubt be a lot of query cache updating
code to maintain.

A single forgotten conditional statement or unhandled edge-case in any
of these query cache updaters can lead to a cascade of bugs that are
hard to track down and fix.

Whenever there are changes to the data model or the UI of the
application, it's likely that some changes need to be made to the query
cache updaters as well, since they are tightly coupled with both the
data model and the UI of the application.

This code is not something you should have to write and maintain
yourself, especially since there are other solutions (such as
[Orbit.js](https://orbitjs.com/) and the [Cloud
Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) client-side
SDK) that prove that the desired functionality can be achieved in other
ways which eliminate the need for you to write this kind of code and —
in addition to that — work more reliably.

## The solution

The solution comprises of two libraries:

-   [`@tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/core`](https://github.com/DanielGiljam/tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/tree/main/libs/core)

-   [`@tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/react`](https://github.com/DanielGiljam/tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/tree/main/libs/react)

### `@tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/core`

[`@tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/core`](https://github.com/DanielGiljam/tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/tree/main/libs/core)
is effectively an extension of, a wrapper of, a flavor of or a preset
for
[`@tanstack/query-core`](https://github.com/TanStack/query/tree/v4.16.1/packages/query-core);
the UI framework agnostic core of [TanStack
Query](https://tanstack.com/query).

[`@tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/core`](https://github.com/DanielGiljam/tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/tree/main/libs/core)
is also UI framework agnostic. As the name suggests, it's a library for
using [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) together with
[Orbit.js](https://orbitjs.com/). It exports the following items:

-   **`LiveQueryClient`**<br/>
    Replacement for
    [`QueryClient`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/QueryClient).
    (Extends
    [`QueryClient`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/QueryClient)
    class.)

-   **`LiveQueryClientConfig`**<br/>
    Type definition. (Extends
    [`QueryClientConfig`](https://github.com/TanStack/query/blob/v4.16.1/packages/query-core/src/types.ts#L708-L713)
    interface.)

-   **`QueryMeta`**<br/>
    Module augmented, and declaration merged more specific version of
    the
    [`QueryMeta`](https://github.com/TanStack/query/blob/v4.16.1/packages/query-core/src/types.ts#L51-L53)
    interface.

-   **`GetQueryOrExpressions`**<br/>
    Type definition for a function signature which has a central role
    when using the library.

-   **`LiveQueryObserver`**<br/>
    Replacement for
    [`QueryObserver`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/QueryObserver).
    (Extends
    [`QueryObserver`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/QueryObserver)
    class.)

-   **`LiveInfiniteQueryObserver`**<br/>
    Replacement for
    [`InfiniteQueryObserver`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/InfiniteQueryObserver).
    (Extends
    [`InfiniteQueryObserver`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/reference/InfiniteQueryObserver)
    class.)

Using
[`@tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/core`](https://github.com/DanielGiljam/tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/tree/main/libs/core)
differs from using
[`@tanstack/query-core`](https://github.com/TanStack/query/tree/v4.16.1/packages/query-core)
in that the `LiveQueryClient` constructor requires that you pass it a
reference to an [Orbit.js
`MemorySource`](https://orbitjs.com/docs/api/memory/classes/MemorySource)
and in that you don't pass
[`queryFn`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/query-functions)s to
observers when instantiating them. Instead, the library makes use of the
meta object that
[`@tanstack/query-core`](https://github.com/TanStack/query/tree/v4.16.1/packages/query-core)
associates with each query. In the meta object, you specify a
`getQueryOrExpressions` function which returns the query or expression
which the [default
`queryFn`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/guides/default-query-function)
uses to query the memory source and which is used to create an [Orbit.js
live query](https://orbitjs.com/docs/querying-data#live-queries) which
automatically keeps your query up to date.

[`README.md`](https://github.com/DanielGiljam/tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/tree/main/libs/core),
where how to use the library is covered in greater detail, or check out
the [source code for the example chat
application](https://github.com/DanielGiljam/tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/tree/main/apps/example-chat-app-with-tanstack-query-and-orbitjs)
which uses this solution.

### `@tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/react`

[`@tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/react`](https://github.com/DanielGiljam/tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/tree/main/libs/react)
contains [React](https://react.dev/) bindings for using
[`@tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/core`](https://github.com/DanielGiljam/tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/tree/main/libs/core)
in a [React](https://react.dev/) application. It exports:

-   **`useLiveQuery`**<br/>
    Same as
    [`useQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/useQuery),
    but for when using
    [`@tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/core`](https://github.com/DanielGiljam/tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/tree/main/libs/core).

-   **`useLiveInfiniteQuery`**<br/>
    Same as
    [`useInfiniteQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/useInfiniteQuery),
    but for when using
    [`@tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/core`](https://github.com/DanielGiljam/tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/tree/main/libs/core).

-   **`useLiveQueryClient`**<br/>
    Same as
    [`useQueryClient`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/reference/useQueryClient),
    but for when using
    [`@tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/core`](https://github.com/DanielGiljam/tanstack-query-with-orbitjs/tree/main/libs/core).
