# Introduction

_**Project Fly-By-Wire**_ is about coming up with a solution for better being able to developer better data-heavy web applications.

Cache invalidation is central in the first tier of challenges tackled by _**Project Fly-By-Wire**_.

Also, coming up with a good name for this project was very hard.

The name that was eventually chosen is a reference to the adoption of [Fly-By-Wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly-by-wire) systems in aircraft. The aviation industry's adoption of Fly-By-Wire systems is meant to be seen as analogous to what we're trying to achieve here with data-heavy web applications. The same way that Fly-By-Wire systems in aircraft improve safety, reduce weight, and increase reliability, this project is about coming up with solutions to make it easier to develop data-heavy web applications that are more reliable and more efficient.

The analogy continues, as you'll discover, if you keep reading.

### What are "data-heavy web applications"?

Data-heavy web applications are web applications that needs to display rapidly changing relational data in realtime.

E.g.

-   A typical chat application. ([Slack](https://slack.com/), [Discord](https://discord.com/), [Telegram](https://telegram.org/), [WhatsApp](https://whatsapp.com/), …)
-   A dashboard for a stock trading application. <!-- TODO: give examples of dashboards for stock trading applications -->

## Problem

In my experience, popular patterns for developing web applications fall short when building data-heavy web applications.

There is no "popular pattern" for developing data-heavy web applications.

### What are "popular patterns"?

When I use the term "popular patterns", I'm referring to patterns that are widely adopted and widely encouraged by the web development community.
