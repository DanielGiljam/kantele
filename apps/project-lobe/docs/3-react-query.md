# The React Query pattern

The popular pattern I'm going to use as the primary example is [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) + [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query). From now on I'm going to refer to that pattern as the _**React Query**_ pattern.

<!-- TODO: motivate why The "popular pattern" can be considered The "popular pattern" -->

Most of the attributes of the _React Query_ pattern that are relevant to this context applies to other popular patterns as well. When this isn't the case, I'll try explicitly point it out.

<!-- TODO: list other popular patterns that exhibit the same limitations as the React Query pattern -->
