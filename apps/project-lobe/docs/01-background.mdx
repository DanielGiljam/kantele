# Background

## Tanstack Query

[Tanstack Query][tq] (formerly known as _React Query_) by [Tanner Linsley](https://tannerlinsley.com/) has 33,984 stars on GitHub as of 11th of April 2023[^1]. In the State of JS Survey 2022, 28% of respondents said that had used it as a data fetching library[^2]. It is part of the increasingly popular open-source fullstack solution [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg)<!-- , created by developer influencer [Theo Browne](https://t3.gg), who has substantial following on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@t3dotgg), [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/theo) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg), where he produces relevant, in-depth, nerdy content for developers-->. [Tanstack Query][tq] is trusted by numerous big companies in production[^3].

I've used [Tanstack Query][tq] for a while now in several projects that I work on and I think it's a great library which elegantly solves many problems and challenges commonly faced when developing web applications. I hope it becomes even more popular and widely adopted. I think it's a "positive" piece of technology and a blessing to the web development community and industry.

It provides the following value:

-   Solution for managing the state of async read and writes and accurately reflecting it in the UI.
    -   Very complex "wheel" to try and "re-invent" yourself.
-   Separation of concerns.
    -   UI components can be written in a truly declarative fashion thanks to its great API design.
-   Good developer experience.
    -   Well designed API which provides both high-level access and low-level access.
    -   Good [documentation][tqd].
    -   Fully-fledged type definitions ([TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) support).
    -   Graphical "dev tools" (which is great for debugging while developing).

In this thesis, the underlying assumption is that [Tanstack Query][tq] is part of our frontend stack, and that is not going to change.

But while it solves many problems and challenges commonly faced when developing web applications, it does not solve all of them. Or by solving some problems and challenges, it takes you to the next level and "unlocks" some new problems and challenges.

In this thesis, I will address what I found to be the most prominent problem which [Tanstack Query][tq] does not solve.

## The Cloud Firestore client-side SDK

The Cloud Firestore client-side SDK is — as the name suggests — a SDK for interacting with [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) from a client application. [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) is a "real-time" database. The downside of [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) is that it's part of [Google](https://about.google)'s proprietary and closed-source "backend-as-a-service" platform [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), which disqualifies its use in a lot of projects, due to reasons such as costs, the risk of vendor lock-in, to name a few.

In this thesis, the underlying assumption is that we cannot use [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) as part of our stack.

</Admonition>

The upside is that it provides an unparalleled interface, in terms of elegance, for dealing with "real-time" data in the client-side code. Combining the positive traits of the [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) client-side SDK with [Tanstack Query][tq] could hypothetically solve the most prominent problem I face when developing with [Tanstack Query][tq].

### Cloud Firestore

[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) is a NoSQL document database which is hosted in the cloud and part of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), an app development platform provided by [Google](https://about.google). Its counterparts in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) land and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) land are commonly viewed as being [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb) and [CosmosDB](https://cosmos.azure.com), respectively, although there are significant differences between the databases in terms of their design and functionality.

What in my opinion mostly distinguishes [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) from similar solutions is its "real-time" functionality — a set of capabilities inherited from its predecessor / sibling product [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database), for which the "real-time" functionality was the main selling point back in the day.

### "Real-time" databases

A "real-time" database — such as [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database) — is a database which provides a mechanism for clients to subscribe to be notified about changes to the data in the database. In the case of [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database) as well as [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore), the implementation of this mechanism is by design hidden to the consumer of the service(s). [Google](https://about.google)'s backend and the client-side SDK work in tandem to provide a high-level way of consuming "real-time" data.

In [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore)'s client-side SDK, this is done by using the [`onSnapshot` API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/listen). It lets you listen to when the result of a database query changes.
