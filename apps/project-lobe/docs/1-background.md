# Background

My name is Daniel Giljam and I'm the author of this project. I started this project when I needed to write my Bachelor's thesis in Information Technology. The project is about web development — which I'm very passionate about — and aims to solve what I experienced to be the greatest problem when developing data-heavy web applications during the past three years as a web developer working on a heavy-duty web application on the side of my studies. I'm very invested in solving this problem and it's clear to me that this is the topic I want to write my thesis about.

However, the scope of this project is too large for a Bachelor's thesis. So in my thesis I'm going to focus on the first tier of challenges in the tiers of challenges that I've identified.
